### Installation

1. Clone the repository
  ```Shell
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ayana-Inria/GLMB-adaptive-birth-satellite-videos
  ```

2. Install the required libraries
```Bash
# install required libraries
pip install requirements.txt
```


### Usage

To run the demo
```Bash
python demo.py
```

To train and test a Faster R-CNN detector using the **alternating optimization** algorithm from our NIPS 2015 paper, use `experiments/scripts/faster_rcnn_alt_opt.sh`.
Output is written underneath `$FRCN_ROOT/output`.

```Shell
cd $FRCN_ROOT
./experiments/scripts/faster_rcnn_alt_opt.sh [GPU_ID] [NET] [--set ...]
# GPU_ID is the GPU you want to train on
# NET in {ZF, VGG_CNN_M_1024, VGG16} is the network arch to use
# --set ... allows you to specify fast_rcnn.config options, e.g.
#   --set EXP_DIR seed_rng1701 RNG_SEED 1701
```

("alt opt" refers to the alternating optimization training algorithm described in the NIPS paper.)

To train and test a Faster R-CNN detector using the **approximate joint training** method, use `experiments/scripts/faster_rcnn_end2end.sh`.
Output is written underneath `$FRCN_ROOT/output`.

```Shell
cd $FRCN_ROOT
./experiments/scripts/faster_rcnn_end2end.sh [GPU_ID] [NET] [--set ...]
# GPU_ID is the GPU you want to train on
# NET in {ZF, VGG_CNN_M_1024, VGG16} is the network arch to use
# --set ... allows you to specify fast_rcnn.config options, e.g.
#   --set EXP_DIR seed_rng1701 RNG_SEED 1701
```

This method trains the RPN module jointly with the Fast R-CNN network, rather than alternating between training the two. It results in faster (~ 1.5x speedup) training times and similar detection accuracy. See these [slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xtr4yd4i5e0vw8g/iccv15_tutorial_training_rbg.pdf?dl=0) for more details.

Artifacts generated by the scripts in `tools` are written in this directory.

Trained Fast R-CNN networks are saved under:

```
output/<experiment directory>/<dataset name>/
```

Test outputs are saved under:

```
output/<experiment directory>/<dataset name>/<network snapshot name>/
```
